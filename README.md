# Python Projects

### Description
This repo contains small projects related to the coding of algorithm functions and their applications in datasets:

- Clustering: DBSCAN_Notebook
- Deep Learning functions (.py files mostly): GradientDescent (notebook), Keras Architecture, Perceptron, Tensorflow_network, cross_entropy_function, perceptron_logical_operator, softmax_function
- Deep Learning mini-projects (notebooks): IMDB_In_Keras, StudentAdmissionsKeras

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [keras](https://keras.io/#installation)
- [tensorflow] (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

It will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

Download the files to a folder directory in your computer.  

Codes are in notebook files with extensions `.ipynb` or Python files `.py`. 

### Notebook Run

In a terminal or command window, run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software. Select the notebook in your directory so it can appear in your browser.

To see the Python files, open Anaconda Spyder, open a Python file in your directory, select Run All

## Data

The datasets used in the notebooks have extensions `.csv`. Python files use mini sample datasets that are randomly generated.
